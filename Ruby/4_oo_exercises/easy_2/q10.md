OOP makes it easier for programmers to organize code.
It is easier to avoid duplicate functions (methods) as they can be grouped into modules, or parent classes.

- Allow programming to think at a higher level of abstraction when writing code.
- Easier to conceptualize since nouns can represent objects
- Only expose functionality to parts of the code that need it.
- Avoid duplication of functions.
- Re-use pre-written code.
- More easily manage complexity of the software.
